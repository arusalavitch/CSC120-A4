- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    It seems that it's much easier to have distinct classes/modules that interact with each other than having to define new functions that do similar things within each class. It also helped me because when I changed something within one class it would immediately work within another part of another class that called it. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    It definitely took me a while to figure out how to test the Train class and I'm still not sure that I really tested everything that I needed to. My classes by themselves seem to run perfectly fine and everything compiles as it is supposed to. I would take more time with the passenger class and maybe put more in there instead of putting it into the train class because that would be better for each passenger to have access to their own functions of getting on and getting off (which I did but not the most efficiently), but I think it works as it is right now.
